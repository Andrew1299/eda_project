# eda_project
a repo for my exploratory data analysis project for the course ITP 449 (USC)

This is an analysis of marine weather and sea conditions as reported by the San Francisco Bar Buoy # 46026. The analysis was done on wave and wind conditions to draw conclusions about trends in buoy data that affected the quality of surfing conditions at nearby Ocean Beach, San Francisco, during the year 2020. 

The dataset for this project can be found in "SFBARBUOY46026h.csv".
